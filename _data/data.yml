  details: |
    As an engineer, I love tackling difficult problems, especially while collaborating with other passionate people. I embody my personal values of empathy, hardwork, and creativity to elevate any team I'm a part of. Moving into management and engineering leadership has made me a better engineer, as I learned how to balance competing priorities, lead others, develop careers, ask difficult questions, and make difficult decisions. While the wins are farther and fewer inbetween, I find engineering leadership fulfilling, as the  wins are bigger and more satisfying on a different scale. That said, I still enjoy being an IC and having "hands-on-keyboard".
