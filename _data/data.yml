        As the manager of Slack's Monitoring Infrastructure team, my focus is on reducing the discrepancy between the number of services and the number of team members, while helping to align the team on a long term roadmap and executing on our short term goals. To achieve these goals, I have implemented a number of key initiatives, including automating repetitive maintenance tasks to improve team productivity, introducing efficient processes to streamline workflows, and investing in team learning to prevent repeat problems from occurring. Through these efforts, I am working to build a more effective and efficient team, and am committed to driving positive change and continued success at Slack.

        As a technical lead manager at Slack, I took on a critical role in leading and navigating the team through a period of stress and turmoil. During my trial period in this role, I successfully delivered major initiatives such as GovSlack, a major upgrade from ELK5 to ELK7, and various service ownership transfers, service deprecations, and migrations.

        As a member of Slack's Visibility Infrastructure team, I played a key role in the adoption of Prometheus to replace the existing metrics system.

In this role, I helped scale the company's logging and metrics systems to support a growing team of engineers, which grew from 40 to nearly 200. As part of this effort, I implemented Kafka at Slack to serve as a buffer for logs and other data that were used to power key business metrics. My work on the Visibility Operations team helped to ensure that Slack had the necessary infrastructure in place to support the growth and development of the company, and my efforts to scale and improve the logging and metrics systems were critical to the success of the team.

I was also part of a small group of engineers who were on-call for all of Slack during its formative years, ensuring the platform was available and performing optimally for users around the world.
